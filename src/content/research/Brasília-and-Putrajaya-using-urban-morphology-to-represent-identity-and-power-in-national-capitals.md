Smart city is a popular concept used widely by policy makers and administrators to promote socio-technological advancement in urban cities. In a disquisition of idealism of the smart city, it would be fruitful if we could at the same time highlight some of the challenges to achieving the very idealism we advocate. To speak of utopianism without any serious reflection, refining and re-examining in putting the ideals into practice is mere rhetorical idealism and failure to plan. This paper sets out to investigate how the city of Putrajaya, aspiring to become a smart city, can manage the expectations to realize that ambition. We present a narrative exploring the practical challenges Putrajaya has been facing in its ongoing efforts to be a smart city. Active idealism as put forward in this paper refers to the recognition of the humanistic ideals that are to be manifested or practiced in individuals and society
