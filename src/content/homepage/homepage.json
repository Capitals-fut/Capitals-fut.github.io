  "aboutDescription": "This research website serves as a platform for academics, planners, and the public to investigate how future-oriented imaginations impact urban planning and design, particularly in Singapore, Putrajaya, and Nusantara. It explores the roles of governments, societal actors, and market forces in urban development by using other cities as reference points in various contexts. By adopting an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates geography, sociology, history, and urban planning, the site aims to stimulate discussions on the environmental, technological, and civilizational factors that shape and reshape the planning of future cities."
